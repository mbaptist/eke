EKE - Eelectrokinetic Equations
Copyright (C) 2008 Manuel Baptista <mbaptist@gmail.com>

Currently (May 2015) the project does not work with the most recent version of the blitz++ library
Any version less or equal to 0.9 should be enough to compile and run the project. 

For a local install under the eke directory, download and uncompress the tarball to some directory:
./configure --prefix=${EKE_DIR_ABS_PATH}/install --enable-shared --enable-static --enable-64bits --with-pic -libdir=${EKE_DIR_ABS_PATH}/install/lib64
make
make install

This will work with the build.py script, without any further options.


Please install an appropriate version of blitz++ globally or to a local directory. For local install please pass the path of its prefix to the build script or to the cmake command, as described below. 

COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION WITH build.py SCRIPT

Get the sources

./build.py 
will build and install in separate subdirectories inside the source directory



COMPILATION AND INSTALATION PROCEDURE WITH CMAKE

Get the sources

mkdir [PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR]

cd [PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR]

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[PATH_OF_INSTALL_PREFIX] -DBLITZ_PREFIX=[PATH_OF_BLITZ_PREFIX][PATH_OF_SOURCE]

make

make install

In the test directory, there are four config files, one for each generated executable. To run use:
 exec_path/executable cfg_path/configfile.cfg

Vtk files will generated with the initial condition and the solution.
