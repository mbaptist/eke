The purpose of this project is to provide a library framework and a set of tools to study the Electrokinetic equations.

The current version (0.1.0) implements a numeric solver for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation with a Maggs-like algorithm. The derivation of the algorithm was part of my postdoc activities in the theory group of the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research (http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de), Mainz, Germany (08/06/2007-31/08/2008).
