This directory contains sample input files for the programs.

For instance, if $EKE_TREE is the path to the eke directory,
	cd $EKE_TREE
	../pb_colloid '/people/thnfs/homes/baptista/actions/projects/eke/testing/pb_colloid.cfg
runs the Maggs algorithm for a colloidal sphere placed at the centre of a cubic box.

The other sample programs include the double plane, spherical capacitor and plane capacitor. The input files (.cfg) should be self explanatory.
